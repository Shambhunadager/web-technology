        <div class="colum"> On the site, source code examples with explanations are shown free of charge in English, 
            most of which can also be edited and executed interactively in a live editor. 
            Other important code elements are hidden so that the user can focus on the code shown (developer sandbox). 
            The tutorials are divided into individual chapters on the development languages. In addition to the basics, 
            application-related implementation options and examples, as well as a focus on individual elements of
             the programming language (so-called "references") are documented. In addition, there is a YouTube channel,
             which takes up and explains certain topics in web development, and an Internet forum. </div>
